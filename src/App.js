They know that it worksâ€”that it produces a desired outcome. But they either don't understand exactly how, or worse, they have an inaccurate mental model for the how that falters on closer scrutiny."

This authoritative book scrapes away these bad features to reveal a subset of JavaScript that's more reliable, readable, and maintainable than the language as a whole-a subset you can use to create truly extensible and efficient code.
